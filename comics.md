Comics are a very popular form of programming humor. For some, creating a comics is a way to release their frustration. Others got popular or even paid for making comics about IT or an adjacent field. 

In this example, I will show my favourite examples of programming comics. 

## MonkeyUser

A popular webcomic, created by active developers, is [MonkeyUser](https://www.monkeyuser.com/).

## xkcd

xkcd is a very popular webcomic. It's creator, Randall Munroe, worked on robots at NASA's Langley Research Center in Virginia. This was not a typical programming career, but surely involved a lot of programming. That is why many xkcd comics relate to programmers, and often strictly touch programmers problems. Here are a few prominent examples:
