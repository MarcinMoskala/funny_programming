We, developers, created our own subculture. No wonder, there are over [24 millions of us worldwide](https://www.future-processing.com/blog/how-many-developers-are-there-in-the-world-in-2019/). We share similar problems and frustrations. Among us, there are many musicians (I am sometimes surprised how many) and other kinds of artists. No wonder our community produces some funny video or a comic from time to time.

I like to reference them during programming discussions. I am then often surprised, when some of my colleagues do not know them. That is why I decided to collect my favourite funny arts of programming community. In this article, I will show my favorite videos.

Let's start with my personal favorite. **Wat** was initially presented as an lightning talk, but it was a great hit, so the formula was later repeated for many languages and other crazy examples. Here is the link to the original one, you can search YouTube for more ;)

### YouTube Channels

There are a bunch of YouTube channels making funny videos for developers. Some of them do that to promote a company. In other case, it is just a group of developers having fun. Here I present a viral video *The Mysterious Life of Developers*, and an example video from the channel KRAZAM.

### Music video

A big part of our culture is music parodies. The oldest one I know is *Write in C*, that is an absolute classic. You can also see an amazing *Write in Go* presented years later by a whole choir on a ScaleAbility conference.

### Movie trailer parodies

A popular conference, JavaZone, created a bunch of funny movie trailer parodies.

## TikTok and other short videos

On the end, it is worth mentioning, that some developers create funny videos in a TikTok/Instagram style. As an example, I will present [cassidoo (Cassidy Williams)](https://twitter.com/cassidoo) and [tired_actor (Alison Burke)](https://twitter.com/TiredActor). Both create great videos.

### Popular culture

There are videos, that are not directed strictly to programmers, but are about nerds or nerd culture. I think it is worth mentioning a few pearls.

### Bonus for Polish

In Poland, we have our specific subculture of programming humour. We have some popular channels all dedicated to a humour for programmers (even non-developers know well [hrejterzy](https://www.youtube.com/c/HRejterzy)). That is why I will also share a few of my favorite Polish-language videos.
